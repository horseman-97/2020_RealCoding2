Code analysis is for making test case, and it is written by input and expect value.<br>
Remember that the dynamic test can be divided by the format of test subject. 
While testing, if we look the code, it is whitebox test. Otherwise, it is blackbox.
<br>
Dynamic test contains
1. testcase
2. testware(similare as execution environment)
3. test result

Dynamic test is opposite with static test. It takes more time and effort, but it can verify the execution of each functions, and makes less false alarm.
One of the methods decides dynamic test ending is `test coverage`. It means a quantative figure for perfection.<br>

For change arraytest coverage, what we have to do is goes to test information section and handle array elements.

After this, we can get 100% coverage. <Br>
This is same on staticvartest function.
